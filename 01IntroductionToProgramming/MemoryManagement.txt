Memory management:

*****Important Points*****
1] More than one refrence variable can point to one object.
2] If any one refrence valriable changes the object, the object wil be changed for all the refrence variables pointing towards it.


Types of memory in programming languages:
	1] Stack memory
	2] Heap memory
	
For Eg:
a=10

Here,
 a is Reference Variable.
 10 is Object.
 
Variables is stored in stack. Object is stored in heap.
So, a in stack and 10 in heap.

It means, a is pointing towards 10.
