*** How Java Code Executes ***

1] Write the java code in a file with ".java" extension.
2] We compile the code by sending it to java compiler, in return we get a byte code as known as a class file with extension ".class".
3] Finally, we run the java interpreter (JVM) and then code get's executed line by line.

What do you mean by platform independence ?
- Byte code can run on all OS.
- JAVA is platform-independent but JVM is platform-dependent.
- c/c++ is platform-dependent.

*** JAVA Architecture ***
JDK - Java devlopment kit   = JRE + Development Tools
JRE - Java runtime Env		= JVM + Library Classes
JVM - Java Virtual Machine	= JIT
JIT	- Just In Time
